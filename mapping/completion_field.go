// spell correction or did-you-mean functionality like the term or phrase
// suggesters.

// Ideally, auto-complete functionality should be as fast as a user types to
// provide instant feedback relevant to what a user has already typed in. Hence,
// completion suggester is optimized for speed. The suggester uses data
// structures that enable fast lookups, but are costly to build and are stored
// in-memory.
